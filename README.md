# Sudoku-Solver
## Purpose
----------
This program can solve any sudoku puzzle, It was written in python using the colorama module for printing colours to the terminal

## Modus Operandi:
-----------------
The algorithm it uses is called recursive backtracking, which is where the program works out all possible solutions for the first part of the problem and then moves on to the second part using the first as a base, when it hits a roadblock it immediately moves back to the last available point on the tree. this process is repeated until it comes to an answer.
